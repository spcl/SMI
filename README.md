# Streaming Message Interface

**Streaming Message Interface** is a a distributed memory HLS programming model for **FPGAs** that provides
the convenience of message passing for HLS-programmed hardware devices. Instead of bulk transmission, typical of message passing model, 
with SMI messages are **streamed** across the network during computation, allowing communication to be seamlessly integrated into pipelined designs.

This repository contains an high-level synthesis implementation of SMI targeting OpenCL and Intel FPGAs, and all the 
applications used for the evaluation perfomed in the paper: *"Streaming Message Interface: High-Performance Distributed Memory
Programming on Reconfigurable Hardware"*, Tiziano De Matteis, Johannes de Fine Licht, Jakub Ber√°nek, and Torsten Hofler. In Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis, 2019 (SC 2019).


Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/spcl/SMI/wiki) and to the paper for a reference on how to use SMI for your own distributed FPGA programs.


## Reproducing the paper experiments

All the tests and evaluations reported in the paper have been performed on a set of Bittware 520N cards (Stratix 10),
each of them equipped with 4 network connections (QSFP modules) operating at 40Gbit/s.

### Requirements

The library depends on:

* CMake for configuration
* Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL pro, version 18.1 ([http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/opencl/](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/opencl/)). *Experimental: support for v19+*
* GCC (version 5+)
* An MPI implementation (e.g. OpenMPI)
* Python (version 3+)
* CLang (version 8+)

### Compilation

After cloning this repository, make sure you clone the submodule dependency, by executing the following command:

```
git submodule update --init
```

The project uses CMake for configuration. To configure the project and build the bitstreams and executables:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
The experiments shown in the paper are organized in two subdirectories of the CMake folder, `microbenchmarks` and `examples`.

For each of them the following targets are offered:

- `make <application>_emulator` builds the emulation version of the FPGA program;
- `make <application>_host` builds the host program;
- `make <application>_<program>_aoc_report` generates the report;
- `make <application>_<program>_aoc_build` builds the hardware (can take several hours).

The applications presents in the repository are the following. For the details please refer to the paper:

**Microbenchmarks**

- `bandwidth`: bandwidth microbenchmark: an MPMD application composed by two programs, namely `bandwidth_0` (sender) and `bandwidth_1` (receiver);
- `latency`: latency microbenchmark: an MPMD application composed by two programs, namely `latency_0` (source) and `latency_1` (destination).
- `injection`: injection microbenchmark: an MPMD application composed by two programs, namely `injection_0` (sender) and `injection_1` (receiver).
- `broadcast`: broadcast microbenchmark: an SPMD application (`broadcast`)
- `reduce`: reduce microbenchmark:  an SPMD application (`reduce`)
- `scatter`: scatter microbenchmark (not included in the paper): an SPMD application (`scatter`)
- `gather`: gather microbenchmark (not included in the paper):  an SPMD application (`gather`)

**Application examples**

- `stencil_smi`: stencil application, smi implementation. It is composed by a single program (`stencil_smi`);
- `stencil_onchip`: on chip version of the stencil application;
- `gesummv_smi`: gesummv, smi implementation: composed by a two programs (`gesummv_rank0` and `gesummv_rank1`);
- `gesummv_onchip`: on chip version of the gesummv application.

**Unit tests**

To enable unit tests, please execute `cmake` with the following flag `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON`


**Please Note**: all the host programs have been written by considering the target architecture used in the paper, which is characterized by a set of nodes each one having 2 FPGAs.
If you are using a different setup, please adjust the host programs.

### Example 

Suppose that the user wants to execute the `stencil_smi` application in emulation.
The following steps must be performed:

```bash
cd examples
# Compile the emulation version
make stencil_smi_emulator -j
# Compile the host program
make stencil_smi_host
cd stencil_smi
# Execute the program
env  CL_CONFIG_CPU_EMULATE_DEVICES=8 mpirun -np 8 ./stencil_smi_host emulator <num-timesteps>
```

To generate the report, from the `examples` directory in the CMake folder, the user must execute:
```bash
make  stencil_smi_stencil_smi_aoc_report
```

The report will be stored under `examples/stencil_smi/stencil_smi`.



#### Stencil parameters

For the stencil application, the stencil sizes and number of ranks in either dimension are configured using CMake parameters:

```bash
cmake .. -DSMI_STENCIL_SIZE_X=8192 -DSMI_STENCIL_SIZE_Y=8192 -DSMI_STENCIL_NUM_PROCS_X=2 -DSMI_STENCIL_NUM_PROCS_Y=2
```

Other parameters include `SMI_VECTORIZATION_WIDTH`, `SMI_DATATYPE`, `SMI_FMAX`, and `SMI_ROUTING_FILE`.
